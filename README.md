Shiba sensei is a puzzle game built in "vanilla" javascript, HTML and CSS.
<br>It uses two API's: shibe.online, which grabs a random image of a shibe inu,
<br>and the Web Audio API, for sound effects. More specifically, it uses the Howler.js
<br>library and some free mp3's from SoundBible.com, so remember to turn your sound on!


This is what a solved image looks like:
